# Semantic_Segmentation
The code implements semantic segmentation using different methods (FCN, UNET, DeepLab) with Python and Tensorflow2.0

The algorithm is trained with Pacal-VOC. To test the algorithm , run test.py, you should download the dataset from http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/pascal/VOC/voc2012/ and change the db_path in the code accordingly.
